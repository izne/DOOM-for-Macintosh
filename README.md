# DOOM for classic Macintosh 

## id Software's DOOM source code port for classic Macintoshes (68K and PowerPC) as prepared by Lion Inc.

## Intro
In November 2023, on an eBay auction, a CD containing the source code of the classic Macintosh port of DOOM was sold for about 5000 USD. 
Shortly after, an ISO image of that CD was [uploaded to archive.org](https://archive.org/details/doom-mac-source).
The [68K Macintosh community](https://68kmla.org/) is now thrilled to bring performance updates to the original code.

## About this repo
This repository is a fork of the [original Macintosh sourcecode](https://github.com/fluddsskark/DOOM-Mac-src) repo and is a place to coordinate improvements for it.
